# FIFA 2019 Analysis using SQL Project

**Introduction:**

Analyzing football player data is crucial for understanding player statistics, team dynamics, and overall performance in the sport. With datasets like FIFA 19, which provide detailed information on player attributes, we can gain insights into player distributions, team strengths, and financial aspects of football management. This project focuses on performing comprehensive data analysis on the FIFA 19 dataset using SQL to extract meaningful insights and answer key questions about player statistics and team performance.

**Problem Statement:**

The objective of this project is to analyze the FIFA 19 dataset using SQL. The system should include the following components:

**(i) Data Exploration:** Understand the basic structure of the dataset, including the number of players, nationalities, and club affiliations.

**(ii) Statistical Analysis:** Perform calculations to determine total and average wages, identify players with extreme wages, and assess the overall ratings of players.

**(iii) Club Analysis:** Evaluate clubs based on their total and average player ratings to determine which clubs have the strongest squads.

**(iv) Player Preferences:** Analyze player preferences, such as preferred foot and jersey numbers, to uncover patterns and trends.

**(v) Joining Analysis:** Examine player joining dates to identify trends in player acquisitions over time.

**Project Description:**

**• Data Exploration:** Used SQL queries to explore the FIFA 19 dataset, including counting the total number of players, nationalities, and identifying the distribution of preferred foot.

**• Statistical Analysis:** Performed calculations to determine the total and average wages of players, identified the highest and lowest wage earners, and assessed player ratings to find the best and worst performers.

**• Club Analysis**: Analyzed clubs based on total and average ratings of their players to determine the top-performing clubs.

**• Player Preferences**Investigated the distribution of players’ preferred foot and jersey numbers to understand player preferences and their impact on the dataset.

**• Joining Analysis:** Analyzed player joining dates to determine the frequency of new player acquisitions over specific date ranges and years.

**Skills:** SQL
